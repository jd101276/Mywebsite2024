    <h2>What is Poverty?</h2>
    <p>Poverty means that a person doesn't make enough money from their job to meet their basic needs.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="types-of-poverty">
    <h2>Different Types of Poverty</h2>

    <p>There are six types of poverty, including absolute poverty, relative poverty, situational poverty, generational poverty, urban poverty, and rural poverty.</p>

    <h3>1. Absolute Poverty</h3>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Absolute poverty refers to a condition where individuals or households cannot meet basic life-sustaining needs such as food, clean water, shelter, and healthcare. It is typically measured using a poverty line, often set by international organizations like the World Bank (e.g., $1.90 a day).</p>
    <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Individuals living in absolute poverty experience severe deprivation of essential resources and struggle to survive.</p>

    <h3>2. Relative Poverty</h3>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Relative poverty refers to individuals or households whose income or resources are so much lower than the average that they are excluded from the minimum acceptable standard of living in society. It is measured in relation to others in the same society, rather than a fixed threshold.</p>
    <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> People in relative poverty may have their basic needs met but still experience social exclusion and inequality compared to others in their community.</p>

    <h3>3. Situational Poverty</h3>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Situational poverty occurs when an individual or group experiences poverty due to specific circumstances, such as a natural disaster, sudden job loss, illness, or other temporary crises.</p>
    <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> This type of poverty is often short-term, and people can escape it once the situation improves.</p>

    <h3>4. Chronic Poverty</h3>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Chronic poverty refers to a long-term or persistent state of poverty, often passed down through generations. Individuals in chronic poverty typically face multiple and ongoing barriers to overcoming their circumstances.</p>
    <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Chronic poverty is often linked to systemic issues like limited access to education, healthcare, or stable employment opportunities.</p>

    <h3>5. Urban Poverty</h3>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Urban poverty occurs in city or metropolitan areas, where despite the availability of more infrastructure, a significant portion of the population lives in poverty, often in informal settlements or slums.</p>
    <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Urban poverty is marked by overcrowding, inadequate housing, lack of sanitation, and limited access to public services despite the proximity to wealthier urban areas.</p>

    <h3>6. Rural Poverty</h3>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Rural poverty refers to poverty in rural or agricultural areas, where people often rely on farming or informal work. These areas tend to have fewer economic opportunities and limited access to services.</p>
    <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Rural poverty is typically marked by inadequate infrastructure, low agricultural productivity, isolation from markets, and poor access to healthcare and education.</p>

  <section id="causes-of-poverty">
    <h2>Causes of Poverty</h2>
    <p>The causes of poverty are complex and multifaceted, involving a combination of economic, social, political, and environmental factors. Here are some of the major causes:</p>

    <h3>1. Economic Inequality</h3>
    <p><strong>Wealth Distribution:</strong> In many societies, wealth is unevenly distributed. A small portion of the population controls most resources, while the majority remain in poverty.</p>
    <p><strong>Unemployment and Underemployment:</strong> Jobs may be scarce, or existing jobs may not pay enough to cover basic living expenses.</p>

    <h3>2. Lack of Education</h3>
    <p><strong>Limited Access to Education:</strong> Education is a key factor in breaking the cycle of poverty. However, many poor regions lack access to quality education.</p>
    <p><strong>Illiteracy and Skill Gaps:</strong> Without education, individuals may lack the skills required for well-paying jobs.</p>

    <h3>3. Health Issues</h3>
    <p><strong>Chronic Illness or Disability:</strong> Health problems can prevent people from working and drain family resources.</p>
    <p><strong>Limited Access to Healthcare:</strong> Poor regions often lack affordable healthcare, exacerbating health problems and prolonging poverty.</p>

    <h3>4. Political Instability and Conflict</h3>
    <p><strong>War and Civil Unrest:</strong> Political instability can displace populations, destroy infrastructure, and disrupt economies, worsening poverty.</p>
    <p><strong>Corruption and Poor Governance:</strong> Corruption can prevent fair resource distribution, limiting opportunities for the disadvantaged.</p>

    <h3>5. Environmental Factors</h3>
    <p><strong>Natural Disasters:</strong> Disasters like floods or earthquakes can destroy communities, making it harder for people to recover.</p>
    <p><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Climate change affects agricultural production and creates food insecurity, particularly in rural areas.</p>

  <h2>How You Can Help to Stop Poverty</h2>
  <p>Many governments are helping to stop poverty, but you can also help by assisting the poor and needy in your local community or abroad. Encourage your family to donate money or organize a fundraising drive together with others.</p>
